# Features

## Exception Handling

The trait `ExceptionHandling` offers a reasonable defaults for exception and rejection handling.  
The response type is a `ErrorMessage` which additionally transformed to JsonAPI format.  
The ID of the exception is extracted from `X-Trace-Token` header  

Example usage (after extending trait `ExceptionHandling`):
```
val routing = Route.seal {
  optionalHeaderValueByName("x-trace-token") { traceToken =>
    withRequestTimeoutResponse(request => timeoutResponse(traceToken)) {
      myRoutes
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination Support

The trait `PaginationDirectives` offers some helpers for handling pagination:

```
path("filter-test") {
  withOptionalPagination { page =>
    complete {
      page match {
        case Some(page) => ... // A page was requested
        case None => ... // No page was requested
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively you can use:
```
path("filter-test") {
  withPagination { page =>
    complete {
      // page is always set
    }
  }
}
```

The page object has this format

```
sealed trait Order

object Order {
  case object Asc extends Order
  case object Desc extends Order
}

case class PageRequest(index: Int, size: Int, sort: Map[String, Order])
```

This is an example of url: `/filter-test?page=1&size=10` or `/filter-test?page=1&size=10&sort=name,asc;age,desc`

The name of the parameters can be configured through [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config):

```

akka.http {
    extensions {
        pagination{
            index-param-name = "page"
            size-param-name  = "size"
            sort-param-name  = "sort"
            asc-param-name   = "asc"
            desc-param-name  = "desc"
            sorting-separator = ";"
            order-separator  = ","
            defaults {
                enabled = true
                always-fallback = true
                offset = 10
                limit = 10
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Publishing

We use `bintray-sbt` plugin for publishing artifacts, to publish newer version of the library run:
```
sbt publish
```

That's all what is required
